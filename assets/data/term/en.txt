Notwithstanding this Clause 6.2, DIGINEX may use de-identified or aggregate Customer Content for research and analysis purposes including benchmarking and may share de-identified or aggregate Customer Content with any entity for the same purposes. De-identified data is data that is not linked or reasonably linkable to a particular person, Customer or device.

DIGINEX and its affiliates have committed to comply with relevant data protection/privacy legislation, and personal data will be transferred in accordance with DIGINEX’ Data Privacy Policy, a copy of which can be found at <a href="https://www.diginex.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.diginex.com/privacy-policy</a>.  DIGINEX will never share personally identifiable information with third party commercial entities for direct marketing purposes, unless Customer gives DIGINEX affirmative permission.  Customer agrees not to provide any health, payment card or similarly sensitive personal information that imposes specific data security obligations for the processing of such data unless it is a supported feature in the Documentation of the Product.

6.4 <i>SECURITY</i>. DIGINEX will maintain and administer a security policy with physical and technical safeguards designed to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the Customer Content. DIGINEX runs security background checks on all operations staff.

In the event that DIGINEX has determined that a security breach will or is likely to cause harm to the Customer or an Authorized User, DIGINEX will provide Customer with notice of the security breach as promptly as practicable but in no event later than five (5) working days from such determination, unless doing so would be detrimental to DIGINEX’s remediation efforts for such breach. After initial notification, DIGINEX will keep Customer updated on a regular basis and provide a reasonably detailed incident report which may include the steps taken by DIGINEX to investigate the security breach and potential measures to be taken by the Customer to minimize potential damages. The parties understand and agree that DIGINEX may be prevented by law, regulation, or a third-party arrangement from providing such notice(s) and/or reports within the above time frames.
